                    Welcome to the Hide Here Blog — a space where we share updates, productivity tips, and ideas on how
                    to make the most of quick text storage.<br>
                    Whether you’re a developer, student, or just someone who likes keeping things tidy, this is where we
                    post thoughts and news to help you get more done with less clutter.

            <h1>why we built HIDE HERE</h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Keeping small bits of information safe shouldn’t be complicated. <br>
                    We all save links in random chats, notes in multiple apps, and todos in our heads — and then forget
                    them.<br>
                    Hide Here was built to fix that: a simple, fast, text-only place to store what matters, whenever it
                    pops into your head.<br>
                    No distractions, no endless menus — just you and your notes.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h1>Your Privacy Matters</h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Your words, your data. <br>
                    Everything you store in Hide Here stays private — we don’t read, sell, or analyze your notes. <br>
                    You can choose to share specific items with unique links, but that’s always your choice. <br>
                    We believe your digital memory should belong to you.
